# **Step 1** 

Scan the QR Code

Scanning the QR Code in the document gives us the above encrypted text. Upon obervation this string can be seen to have characters ranging from `[a-b], [A-B], [0-9] and even '='`.
A similar character set can be observed in *Base64* syntax.

<br>

# **Step 2**

Run the string through a [*Base64*](#base64) *decrypter*

> Great job. Julius Caeser was born in the 100 BC:

The oddly specific mention of the king 'Julius Caesar' indicates that the initial message has been passed through a *Caesar cipher*. Hence, in-order to reverse it, we will now be applying *Caesar Cipher* on the encrypted message.

<br>

# **Step 3**

Decrypt the message using a [*Caesar Cipher*](#caesar) (upon observation we get that a shift = +22 will output a readable message)

The message 'cipher keysquare without J' is a clear implication of the necessary usage of the *Playfair cipher* in which a 5x5 keysquare is usually made to decrypt the message while excluding the 'J' alphabet (usually)

<br>

# **Step 4**

Decrypt the message using a [*Playfair cipher*](#playfair) with a keysquare *'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'*

> RSAENCRYPTNUMBERTWOHUNDREDFOURTYTHREEWITHNVALUEASTWOTHOUSANDFOURHUNDREDANDNINETEENANDEVALUEASELEVENX

Expanding this string into a more readable format returns `RSA ENCRYPT NUMBER TWO HUNDRED FOURTY THREE WITH N-VALUE AS TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETEEN AND E-VALUE AS ELEVEN X.` 

<br>

# **Step 5**

As per the above result, run the `243` through an RSA encrypter with `n = 2419` and `e = 11`

> Encrypted message = 1982

The encrypted message we get after running the rsa algorithm returns the password for the zip file. Opening the `.txt` file further returns a string

<a name = 'base64'><h3>Base64</h3></a>
As the name suggests, Base64 is an encoding algorithm which helps to convert 8-bit ASCII strings into a 6-bit (2<sup>6</sup>=64) language with a character set consisting of `[A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /] and '='` which is used for padding.

To convert Base64 into ASCII we first read each character in the string, get its index in the *Base64 character set*, convert the decimal value of the index to its bit representation (`bit`) and append the 6-bit string to a master string (`final_bit`).

(Note: we also have to take care of the extra '=' paddings while converting. In my program however, I have manually removed the padding and decremented the total bits by 4 to account for the = signs)

Now I grouped the remaining bits into parts of 8 and converted the binary first to decimal and then to its corresponding ASCII value.

<a name = 'caesar'><h3>Caesar Cipher</h3></a>
Caesar cipher is an algorithm which is typically used to convert a readable string of alphabets into an unreadble alphabet string. Here, a key is first set which denotes the number of rotations for the letters (lets say ***i***) and then each alphabet in the string is incremented/decremented to ***i<sup>th</sup>*** alphabet after it. In case we exceed the alphabets, we wrap back to 'A/a' and increment the rest.

In this task however, I found it much more easier to brute force the caesar cipher and get all 25 possibilities and then pick the one that is legible

<a name = 'rsa'><h3>RSA Encryption</h3></a>
RSA is an asymmetrc encryption algorithm having two different keys, private and public key. It functions on the basis that it is difficult to find the factors of a large composite number, especially if the factors are prime. 

While the math and proofs behind RSA encryption is a bit complex, in a general sense, it follows this formula

`Encrypted message = m<sup>e</sup> % n`

where m = message to be encrypted, e = exponent in public key and n = modulo of public key
